For example, there are 4 synsets for the word \"surf\", one of which is a noun (n) and three of which are verbs (v). WordNet provides a definition and sometimes glosses (examples) for each synset. **Polysemy**, by the way, means having multiple senses."

        "WordNet gives us ways to compare words and understand their relationships in a much more meaningful way than relying on the raw strings (sequences of characters). We know that 'cat' and 'dog', for example, are somewhat similar even though they have no string similarity. As a result, WordNet has been used in lots of practical applications over the years. However, WordNet has a few important shortcomings:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. WordNet was built by people. This makes it hard to maintain as new words are added (e.g. 'iphone' isn't in WordNet) and definitions evolve. It also has limited language coverage. NLTK wraps Open Multilingual WordNet which includes 22 additional languages, but these are less extensive than the English WordNet. A fundamental question addressed by subsequent sections is: can we build WordNet-like resources automatically from text, of which there is an abundance?\n",
        "\n",
        "1. WordNet, like any dictionary or thesaurus, represents the meaning of a word with its relationships to other words. That is, it lacks *grounding* in the real world. This is fine for people who have plenty of working knowledge of the world, who have seen and interacted with dogs and cats and potatoes, but would be much less helpful for aliens arriving on Earth for the first time. This deficiency, where language is only defined with respect to itself, and not with respect to images for example, is at the frontier of research in Natural Language Understanding."
